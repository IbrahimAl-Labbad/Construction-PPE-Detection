# **Construction PPE Detection ðŸš§**

This project utilizes a **YOLOv8** object detection model to identify essential Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on construction workers, such as helmets, vests, gloves, and boots. It ensures safety compliance by detecting whether workers are wearing the required gear.

## **Project Overview**
Ensuring workers wear appropriate PPE on construction sites is crucial for safety. This project leverages YOLOv8 for real-time detection of PPE in images and videos. The model is trained to identify:
- **Helmets**
- **Vests**
- **Gloves**
- **Boots**
- **Humans**

The goal is to assist in safety monitoring and compliance enforcement on construction sites.

---

## **Dataset**
- The dataset contains images of construction workers wearing or not wearing required PPE.  
- **Classes:**  
  - `0: boots`
  - `1: gloves`
  - `2: helmet`
  - `3: human`
  - `4: vest`

**Note:** The dataset used is too large to include in this repository. You can download the dataset from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) or use your own dataset by configuring the `data.yaml` file.

## **Model Training**
We used **YOLOv8** for training and evaluation:
- **Epochs:** 20  
- **Image Size:** 640x640  
- **Optimizer:** SGD/Adam  
- **Loss:** Cross-entropy + IoU Loss  

Trained model weights are saved under `train/weights/`.

## **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IbrahimAl-Labbad/Construction-PPE-Detection.git
   cd Construction-PPE-Detection

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python-headless matplotlib
   
3. Verify the installation by running:
     ```bash
     yolo help
     
## **Usage**
1. Train the Model
   Make sure to modify data.yaml to point to your dataset, then run:
   ```bash
   yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=20 imgsz=640


2. Evaluate the Model
   To validate the model on the validation dataset:
   ```bash
    yolo task=detect mode=val model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt data=data.yaml imgsz=640
   
3. Test the Model
   Run the model on the test dataset:
     ```bash
   yolo task=detect mode=test model=runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt data=data.yaml imgsz=640

## **Results**
The model detects the following PPE equipment:

-  **Helmets:** âœ…
-  **Vests:** âœ…
-  **Gloves:** âœ…
-  **Boots:** âœ…
-  **Humans:** âœ…
